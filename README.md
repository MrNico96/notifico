# Notifico :house: :moneybag: :car:
Listings from private individuals are unfortunately often deactivated after a few minutes, because the demand is too high and they have received many requests.
Scout24's notification function often fails to respond because they have already been deactivated so quickly.

### What exactly does the Bot?
The bot opens a chromium browser every minute you specify and checks for you if there are new entries.
As soon as it has found something new, it informs you by telegram.
After you have started the bot, everything happens in the background without you noticing anything.
Of course you can pause or stop it at any time.
